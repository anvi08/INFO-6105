Furthermore, we call a set of vectors **linearly independent** if no vector in the list is in the span of the others. For example, (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) and are linearly independent in **R**$^3$.

    "I don't think I need to convince you of this, we illustrated this with the mountain climber and the Combo matrix!\n",

    "Assume the mountain climber climbs the entire mountain using just one type of jump, let's call this the **Twist** matrix jump.\n",

That, in fact, is a ***theorem*** that is true if the **Twist** matrix is **non-singular** (has a non-zero [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the mountain climber's position after $n$ **Twist** jumps, we multiply her position vector by the **Twist** matrix, $n$ times, right? Which corresponds to a single multiplication by the matrix **Twist$^n$** (**Twist** to the power $n$), right? Each application of **Twist** adds a factor of the eigenvalue $λ$ to the coefficient of each eigenvector in the expansion of the state. Recall: The eigenvectors don’t transform much.. They just squish or expand (by a factor of $λ$). So after $n$ transitions, the coefficient of each eigenvector has gained a factor $λ^n$.\n",

    "\n",
    "If λ < 1, this factor would suppress the contribution of the corresponding eigenvector as $n$ increases. It’s fine if this happens to some eigenvectors, but if it happens to *all of them*, the probability interpretation of our state vector would also be ruined, because all entries in our vector would be driven to zero, and the mountain climber would **never move**.\n",

    "This eigenvector therefore represents the steady-state towards which every **linear system** tends to.\n",

    "The dominant eigenvector is the future of Markov chains. That is why we love Markov chains: With a bot of math, wwe can predict their future!\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we start with a random vector (random mountain climber position), and apply the **Twist** matrix a million times, we will ultimately converge to the dominant eigenvector, since all other eigenvalue-to-the-power-a-million contributions will become suppressed. \n",

    "So, if $n$ is a large number, what happens to $\\lambda^n$? \n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if $\\lambda < 1$, and what happens if $\\lambda > 1$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it possible that $\\lambda$ is bigger than 1? Does $A^n$ remain *stochastic*?\n",
    "\n",
    "And what if all $\\lambda_i$ are less than one?\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does this tell you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about a Markov chain and its stochastic transition matrix $A$. That matrix has eigenvectors $V_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we are able to represent the state of the system as a **linear combination of the eigenvectors** $V_i$ (we can, there is a theorem in linera algebra that says we can, it's just a change of bases).\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability distribution of states after $n$ transitions, we multiply this vector by $A$, $n$ times, right? Each application of $A$ adds a factor of the eigenvalue $λ$ to the coefficient of each eigenvector in the expansion of the state. Recall: The eigenvectors don’t transform much.. They just squish or expand (by a factor of $λ$). So after $n$ transitions, the coefficient of each eigenvector has gained a factor $λ^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If λ > 1, this factor would grow without bound as $n$ increases, leading to matrix elements larger than 1, which would ruin the probability interpretation of our state vector.. So, there must not be any eigenvalue strictly larger than one!\n",
    "\n",
    "If λ < 1, this factor would suppress the contribution of the corresponding eigenvector as $n$ increases. It’s fine if this happens to some eigenvectors, but if it happens to *all of them*, the probability interpretation of our state vector would also be ruined, because all entries in our vector would be driven to zero..\n",

    "\n",
    "The dominant eigenvector will become the *only unsuppressed contribution* to the state vector as $n$ gets large.\n",
    "This eigenvector therefore represents the steady-state towards which every **linear system** tends to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic matrices are guaranteed to have eigenvalues not larger than one, and to have *at least* one eigenvalue equal to one. The components of the dominant eigenvector are proportional to the relative occupation probabilities of states in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we didn't prove that a Markov chain *has* a steady state, or that it is unique. *Only* that *if* there is a steady state, *and* it is unique, then it is given by the dominant eigenvector. \n",
    "\n",
    "But actually, for Markov chains, there is indeed only one so-called *fixed point* (steady-state). That is why Markov chains are so interesting and sexy. And for the math, go [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note**: These results are very important because they're at the basis of what Google did to mind the Web. They're also central to **graph theory**, and we use graphs to interpolate high-dimensional functions from a cloud of data points, when the math is too complicated to build analytic function models with."

    "Linear algebra in n-dimensional space is all about climbing a mountain in n dimensions, and each step can be represented by multiplying the position vector of the mountain climber by a step-matrix, to move to a new position represented by a new position vector. The position vector is just the arrow from the origin (start of the climb) to the current position of the climber. So as the mountain climber moves, that vector essentially rotates around its axis (the origin), and thus matrix multiplication is essentially a **solid rotation**. A matrix describes a specific kind of mountain move. For that mountain move, the matrice's eigenvectors describe all possible position vectors that are parallel before and after the move, while its eigenvalues describe by how much the climber has actually moved in that direction.\n",
